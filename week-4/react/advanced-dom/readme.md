so basically we implemented a TODO app using DOM Maniplation 
1. setAttribute
2. createEleement
3. appendChild
4. children


and then we learn the beaty of "states" where we dynamically laod the front-end by recieving the data from the backend and display them.

**whwnever the backend thrws the data find the diffs and display the changes that are only needed.

** remember the old todos in variable DOM and find the diff bw them and render the website..
